Lua Compiler for computer science course at Universidade Federal da Bahia, Brazil.

This code was based on the Programming Language processors in Java book. This current version contains the scanner, parser and token class in Java language for the Lua 5.1 language grammar available at http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#8

The LL(1) grammar will be available later or may be requested by email. 

Credits go for me and Clara Aderne, and also parts of the book code freely available on the authors website as described on commentary of the used files.

The method used was the recursive descent parsing explained on the book afore mentioned. 

This code was a created for a Compilers course assignment and may contain error or like proper documentation.

Usage of the code is as follow:

Both Scanner.java and Parser.java have main methods. If the scanner.java is executed, the code will generate output into a .txt file on the local folder where the Scanner.java is. A commentary section includes the code to only print on the terminal if needed.

The parser will output on a terminal window using the Scanner.java class to obtain the necessary tokens from source language.

The name of the file to put the code to be read by the Scanner and Parser as well the name of its output file for the Scanner are described and may be modified if necessary at the main methods.

Finally, the input of the scanner is the lua 5.1 source code and the output is a listen of tokens, its types and the current position on code, and the input of the parser are tokens generated by our scanner and the output is either parse accepting the source corde or rejecting it.
